# flow-chart

1. Create a flow chart for the following problem. 
> **Problem**: Ordering Food Online
> **Scenario**: Imagine you want to order food from a restaurant online. You've selected the restaurant and the items you want to order. Now, you need to go through the process of placing the order on their website.
> **Objective**: Create a flowchart that outlines the steps involved in placing an online food order.

2. Think of another problem on your own. Create another flow chart for it as well.

Once you've created the flow charts, add them to this `README` and push the changes.
